# FTC-Robot-Controller

One of the major courses that I taught during my time at Dr X Academy was the full First Tech Challenge curriculum. This included 3 parts, the first is java, the second is advanced mechanics (via Fusion360) as well as Android Studio coding. This repo contains stage 3, whereby you can open this entire project within Android Studio and controller the robot provided by FIRST and make it do several functions.
